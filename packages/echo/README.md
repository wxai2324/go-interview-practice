## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Basic understanding of HTTP concepts
- Familiarity with JSON and REST APIs
- Basic Go programming knowledge

### Installation
Each challenge includes its own `go.mod` file with the necessary dependencies. Simply navigate to a challenge directory and run:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### Running Tests
Each challenge includes a `run_tests.sh` script for testing your solution:

```bash
cd challenge-1-basic-routing
./run_tests.sh
```

## Learning Path

The challenges are designed to be completed in order, with each building upon concepts from the previous ones:

1. **Basic Routing** - Foundation concepts and simple API creation
2. **Middleware** - Request/response processing and cross-cutting concerns
3. **Validation & Errors** - Input validation and robust error handling
4. **Authentication** - Security, JWT, and access control

## Echo Framework Highlights

### Why Echo?
- **High Performance**: Optimized HTTP router with zero memory allocation
- **Extensible**: Modular design with rich middleware ecosystem
- **Minimalist**: Clean API with minimal boilerplate
- **Standards Compliant**: HTTP/2, IPv6, Unix domain socket support
- **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

### Core Features
- Fast HTTP router with radix tree
- Extensible middleware framework
- Data binding for JSON, XML, and form payload
- Handy functions to send variety of HTTP responses
- Centralized HTTP error handling
- Template rendering with any template engine
- Define middleware at root, group or route level
- Great routers like Apache, Nginx
- HTTP/2 support

### Performance Characteristics
- Zero memory allocation router
- Fast HTTP router based on radix tree
- Optimized for high-performance applications
- Minimal memory footprint
- Excellent benchmarks compared to other frameworks

## Real-World Applications

Echo is used in production by many companies for:
- **Microservices Architecture**: Lightweight services with minimal overhead
- **API Gateways**: High-throughput request routing and processing
- **Real-time Applications**: WebSocket support and efficient connection handling
- **Enterprise APIs**: Robust middleware support for authentication, logging, and monitoring
- **Cloud-Native Applications**: Container-friendly with health checks and metrics

## Best Practices Covered

Throughout these challenges, you'll learn:
- Proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- Middleware design patterns and composition
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security best practices and JWT implementation
- Performance optimization techniques
- Testing strategies for web applications
- API design principles and REST conventions
